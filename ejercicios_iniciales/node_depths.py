"""
The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the node's depth.
Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its nodes' depths.
Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. Children nodes can either be
BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.
