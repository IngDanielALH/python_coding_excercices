"""You're given a 2D array of integers matrix. Write a function that returns the transpose of the matrix. The
transpose of a matrix is a flipped version of the original matrix across its main diagonal (which runs from top-left
to bottom-right); it switches the row and column indices of the original matrix. You can assume the input matrix
always has at least 1 value; however its width and height are not necessarily the same."""
