🎯Problem Explaination:

    We have an array height representing the heights of bars at different positions.
    The goal is to calculate how much water can be trapped between these bars after a rainfall. Each bar has a certain height given by the elements of the height array.

🧠Thinking Behind the Solution:

    The goal is to calculate how much water can be trapped between the bars based on their heights.

    Water can only be trapped at a particular index if there are higher bars on both its left and right sides.

    So, To efficiently determine the maximum elevation to the left and right of each bar, we'll use two arrays:
        left[i]: This array will store the maximum height encountered from the start up to the current index i.
        right[i]: This array will store the maximum height encountered from the end up to the current index i.

    Filling left[] Array:
        Initialize left[0] with the height of the first bar.
        For each subsequent index i, left[i] is computed as the maximum of left[i-1] and the current height height[i]. This ensures that left[i] always holds the maximum height encountered from the start up to i.

    Filling right[] Array:
        Initialize right[n-1] with the height of the last bar.
        For each index i from n-2 down to 0, right[i] is computed as the maximum of right[i+1] and the current height height[i]. This ensures that right[i] always holds the maximum height encountered from i to the end.

    Calculating Trapped Water:

        Once left[] and right[] arrays are populated, iterate through the bars.

        For each bar at index i, calculate the trapped water above it and store it in trappedWaterusing:

        trappedWater += (min(left[i], right[i]) - height[i])

        This formula represents the maximum water that can be trapped above the bar at i, considering the minimum of the highest bars on its left and right minus its own height.

    Final Answer:
        trappedWater holds the value of trapped after after rain.

✅Approach:

To implement the solution for trapping rainwater based on observations, follow these step-by-step instructions:
Step 1: Initialize Variables and Arrays

Start by initializing necessary variables and arrays for the solution.

class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        int n = height.length;
        int[] left = new int[n];  // Array to store maximum height to the left
        int[] right = new int[n]; // Array to store maximum height to the right
        int trappedWater = 0;      // Variable to store the total trapped water

Step 2: Populate the left[] Array

Iterate over the height array from left to right and fill the left[] array with the maximum height encountered so far.

        left[0] = height[0];  // Base case: leftmost bar has no left boundary
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            left[i] = Math.max(left[i - 1], height[i]);
        }

Step 3: Populate the right[] Array

Iterate over the height array from right to left and fill the right[] array with the maximum height encountered so far.

        right[n - 1] = height[n - 1];  // Base case: rightmost bar has no right boundary
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            right[i] = Math.max(right[i + 1], height[i]);
        }

Step 4: Calculate Trapped Water

Iterate over each bar in the height array and compute the trapped water at that position using the left[] and right[] arrays.

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int minHeight = Math.min(left[i], right[i]);
            trappedWater += minHeight - height[i];
        }

Step 5: Return the Result

Return the total amount of trapped water.

        return trappedWater;
    }
}

Let's walkthrough🚶🏻‍♂️ the implementation process with an example for better understanding🎯:

Let's walk through the step-by-step process of calculating the trapped water using the provided height array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] with the approach outlined earlier. We'll track the values of left, right, and trappedWater at each iteration:
Step 0: Initialization

    height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
    n = 12 (length of height)
    left[] and right[] arrays will be initialized later during execution.

Step 1: Fill left[] Array

left[0] = height[0] = 0
left[1] = max(left[0], height[1]) = max(0, 1) = 1
left[2] = max(left[1], height[2]) = max(1, 0) = 1
left[3] = max(left[2], height[3]) = max(1, 2) = 2
left[4] = max(left[3], height[4]) = max(2, 1) = 2
left[5] = max(left[4], height[5]) = max(2, 0) = 2
left[6] = max(left[5], height[6]) = max(2, 1) = 2
left[7] = max(left[6], height[7]) = max(2, 3) = 3
left[8] = max(left[7], height[8]) = max(3, 2) = 3
left[9] = max(left[8], height[9]) = max(3, 1) = 3
left[10] = max(left[9], height[10]) = max(3, 2) = 3
left[11] = max(left[10], height[11]) = max(3, 1) = 3

    left[] = [0,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3]

Step 2: Fill right[] Array

right[11] = height[11] = 1
right[10] = max(right[11], height[10]) = max(1, 2) = 2
right[9] = max(right[10], height[9]) = max(2, 1) = 2
right[8] = max(right[9], height[8]) = max(2, 2) = 2
right[7] = max(right[8], height[7]) = max(2, 3) = 3
right[6] = max(right[7], height[6]) = max(3, 1) = 3
right[5] = max(right[6], height[5]) = max(3, 0) = 3
right[4] = max(right[5], height[4]) = max(3, 1) = 3
right[3] = max(right[4], height[3]) = max(3, 2) = 3
right[2] = max(right[3], height[2]) = max(3, 0) = 3
right[1] = max(right[2], height[1]) = max(3, 1) = 3
right[0] = max(right[1], height[0]) = max(3, 0) = 3

    right[] = [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,1]

Step 3: Calculate Trapped Water

i = 0:
    trappedWater += min(left[0], right[0]) - height[0] = min(0, 3) - 0 = 0 - 0 = 0
    trappedWater = 0

i = 1:
    trappedWater += min(left[1], right[1]) - height[1] = min(1, 3) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0
    trappedWater = 0

i = 2:
    trappedWater += min(left[2], right[2]) - height[2] = min(1, 3) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1
    trappedWater = 1

i = 3:
    trappedWater += min(left[3], right[3]) - height[3] = min(2, 3) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0
    trappedWater = 1

i = 4:
    trappedWater += min(left[4], right[4]) - height[4] = min(2, 3) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
    trappedWater = 2

i = 5:
    trappedWater += min(left[5], right[5]) - height[5] = min(2, 3) - 0 = 2 - 0 = 2
    trappedWater = 4

i = 6:
    trappedWater += min(left[6], right[6]) - height[6] = min(2, 3) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
    trappedWater = 5

i = 7:
    trappedWater += min(left[7], right[7]) - height[7] = min(3, 3) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0
    trappedWater = 5

i = 8:
    trappedWater += min(left[8], right[8]) - height[8] = min(3, 2) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0
    trappedWater = 5

i = 9:
    trappedWater += min(left[9], right[9]) - height[9] = min(3, 2) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
    trappedWater = 6

i = 10:
    trappedWater += min(left[10], right[10]) - height[10] = min(3, 2) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0
    trappedWater = 6

i = 11:
    trappedWater += min(left[11], right[11]) - height[11] = min(3, 1) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0
    trappedWater = 6

Final Result

The total trapped water after rain for the given height array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] is 6 units.
